            impactful software. With experience in AI, full-stack web development, and cloud technologies, I specialize in
            creating impactful tools that empower individuals and drive meaningful change. Skilled in Python, JavaScript,
            React, and Django, among other technologies, I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn
